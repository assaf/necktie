    <p>This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build program with
    capabilities similar to make.</p>

    <p> Rake has the following features: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rakefiles (rake&#8217;s version of Makefiles) are completely
      defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky
      Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)</li>
      <li>Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.</li>
      <li>Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.</li>
      <li>Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
      projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon rake do not
      require that rake be installed on target systems.</li>
    </ul>
